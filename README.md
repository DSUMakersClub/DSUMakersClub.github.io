# The DSU Makers Club
The DSU Makers club, in the most basic sense, takes raw material and turns it into a finished product.
The goal of the club is to gather students who have a passion for DIY projects and pool our skills to realize projects that would not be doable by our selves.
We have members that Knit, Sew, work with leather, are woodworkers, 3D modelers, costume makers, prop makers and everything in between.
