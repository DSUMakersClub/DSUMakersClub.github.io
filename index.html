    <!-- Pff, some sorta ethos or something? -->
    <p>The goal of the club is to gather students who have a passion for DIY projects and pool our skills to realize projects that would not be doable by our selves.</p>
    <p>We have members that Knit, Sew, leatherwork, woodwork, 3D model, craft props, and everything in between!</p>
