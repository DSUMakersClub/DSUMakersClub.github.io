<p><b>The DSU Makers club</b>, in the most basic sense, takes raw material and turns it into a finished product.</p>
<p>The goal of the club is to gather students who have a passion for DIY projects and pool our skills to realize projects that would not be doable by our selves.</p>
<p>We have members that Knit, Sew, work with leather, are woodworkers, 3D modelers, costume makers, prop makers and everything in between.</p>
